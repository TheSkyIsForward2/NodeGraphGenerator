# Feedback and Changelog

## Feedback Notes

Tate Maguire
“It was intuitive”
“Make it more sharable by making the tunable parameters changeable in the product and not in the code”
Found that having min and max width parameters the same makes the generator disregard them.

Florian Ionescu
“Appreciate that there are three intuitive knobs”
Wishes there was a GUI for the knobs
Set the limits

Tyler Coleman
Suggested an export button that will save a file containing the information of the graph
Suggested a type of node being left open so that the edges would propagate across columns

## Changes made:
- Added basic GUI changes to allow for constant, user prompted generation and parameter change through panels and buttons on the left side of the GUI.
- Added a button and saving feature that allowed for the graph to be saved in adjacency matrix format to a JSON file.
